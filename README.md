# PCM SMART EHR Module (Angular 4 based)

## About

<Add info here, along the lines of 'oncologists have had lackluster tools for the past years'>

## Development Testing Instructions 

1. Create a new account on the [HSPC sandbox](sandbox.hspconsortium.org).  
2. Create a new sandbox from your HSPC account.  
3. Navigate to the Registered Apps tab on the left side of the page, and click 'register a new app manually'.  
4. Register the app values as launch: http://127.0.0.1:4200/smart-launch, and redirect uri(s): http://127.0.0.1:4200/token-reception
5. Create a new persona with the default practitioner (John Smith).  
6. Create a new launch scenario with a random patient and this new persona.  Link it to this newly registered app.  
7. ```cd``` to the cloned repository on your local machine and run ```ng serve```.  
8. Launch your app by either navigating to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200), which provides no SMART context, or via the HSPC sandbox and launch it using your new launch scenario.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### TO-DO
1. Continue working on FHIR support (i.e. for queries and results)*
2. Look into Angular + Boostrap Framework
3. Create Service for Intelligent Search (i.e. figure out a way to automatically populate a dataset with the required IDs)
